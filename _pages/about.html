### Nobody really understands quantum mechanics - Richard Feynman

I am a Ph.D. student in Theoretical Chemistry at The University of Chicago,
working with Prof. [Giulia Galli](https://galligroup.uchicago.edu/People/galli.php). I am also closely working with Dr. [Olivier Parcollet](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/olivier-parcollet) at Center for Computational Quantum Physics, Flatiron Institute.
I received my dual bachelors in Physics and Chemistry from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I worked with Prof. [Tao Xiang](http://txiang.iphy.ac.cn) and Prof. [Qiang Shi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qiang-Shi-5).

I am broadly interested in quantum many-body physics, quantum simulation and computation, and scientific computing. Please see the CV page for details.
