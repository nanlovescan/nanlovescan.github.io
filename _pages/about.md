- My research interests lie in general area of machine learning and deep learning, especially their applications in networks, recommender systems and computational advertising.

- I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree of Software Engineering in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My undergraduate research advisors are Prof. [Weinan Zhang](http://www.wnzhang.net) and Prof. [Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu). -->

<!-- ## Nobody really understands quantum mechanics - Richard Feynman -->
- I am an applied mathematician understanding the math structure of the natural sciences, with a specific focus on quantum physics.

- My main interests lie in developing **fundamental theories**, **advanced and robust computational methods**, as well as **practical and sophisticated software** to solve the quantum many-body problem and to predict the behaviors of matter of scientific and technological interest. Please see the [Research](/research) page for details.

- I am currently a graduate student in Theoretical Chemistry at University of Chicago, working with Prof. [Giulia Galli](https://galligroup.uchicago.edu/People/galli.php). 

- I have collaborative connections with Dr. [Olivier Parcollet](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/olivier-parcollet), Dr. [Jason Kaye](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/jason-kaye/) and Dr. [Kun Chen](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/kun-chen-2/) at the Computational Quantum Physics, Flatiron Institute.

- I received my dual Bachelor's degree in Physics and Chemistry with highest honors from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I worked with Prof. [Tao Xiang](http://txiang-iphy.cn) and Prof. [Qiang Shi](http://159.226.64.165/web/qshi/prof.).

<!-- - My main interests lie in investigating inner mathematical structure of quantum physics, developing advanced and robust computational methods for quantum physics problems, and applying these developed methods to the problems. Additionally, I'm in general interested in developing scienfic computing tools for scientific computing. Please see the [Research](/research) page for details. -->

# Recent news

- The paper [Quantum embedding theories to simulate condensed systems on quantum computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04736) has just been accepted by Nature Computational Science (6/15/2022)! It is aimed at discussing different embedding theories and the perspective for their simulations on quantum computers.
- I gave an exciting talk in the APS March meeting on solving the double counting issue in quantum defect embedding theory! See the slides [here](/files/talks/Nan_Sheng_2022.pdf). I also contribute to Dr. Christian Vorwerk's talk on the application of the embedding theory to oxides. See the slides [here](/files/talks/Christian_Vorwerk_2022.pdf).
- The paper [Green's function formulation of quantum defect embedding theory](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00240) has just been accepted and published by Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation (6/1/2022)! It is aimed at solving the double counting issue in quantum defect embedding theory (3/12/2022).
- I gave an exciting talk as the end of my experience (8/13/2021)! See the slides [here](/files/talks/DLR%40CCQ.pdf). I will work remotely with colleagues to finish the project.
- I just start an internship at Flatiron Institute, working with Dr. Olivier Parcollet, Dr. Jason Kaye and Dr. Kun Chen (6/3/2021).
