<!-- - I am currently a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn), advised by Prof. [Weinan Zhang](http://www.wnzhang.net) and Prof. [Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu). [\[Curriculum Vitae\]](/files/CV.pdf). [\[Google Scholar\]](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JPBGjOYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

- My research interests lie in general area of machine learning and deep learning, especially their applications in networks, recommender systems and computational advertising.

- I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree of Software Engineering in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My undergraduate research advisors are Prof. [Weinan Zhang](http://www.wnzhang.net) and Prof. [Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu). -->

<!-- ## Nobody really understands quantum mechanics - Richard Feynman -->

- I am a Ph.D. student in Theoretical Chemistry at University of Chicago, working with Prof. [Giulia Galli](https://galligroup.uchicago.edu/People/galli.php). I am also collaborating with Dr. [Olivier Parcollet](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/olivier-parcollet) at Center for Computational Quantum Physics, Flatiron Institute.

- I received my dual Bachelor's degree in Physics and Chemistry with highest honors from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I worked with Prof. [Tao Xiang](http://txiang.iphy.ac.cn) and Prof. [Qiang Shi](http://159.226.64.165/web/qshi/prof.).

- I am broadly interested in hybrid quantum-classical theories and methods, including quantum many-body physics, quantum computation and simulation, and scientific computing. Please see the [Research](/research) page for details.
