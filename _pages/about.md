<!-- ## Nobody really understands quantum mechanics - Richard Feynman -->
- I am an applied mathematician committed to understanding the mathematical structure of natural sciences, with a specific focus on quantum physics. 

<!-- I can also be a physicist or a chemist if necessary.  -->

- I am broadly interested in performing **numerical analysis** and developing **scientific computing** tools for problems arising in natural sciences. Specifically, I am an expert in developing fundamental theories**, advanced and robust computational methods, as well as practical and sophisticated software to solve the **quantum many-body problem** and to predict the behaviors of matter of scientific and technological interest. For more details, please see the [Research](/research) page.

- I am currently a graduate student at the University of Chicago, working with Prof. [Yuehaw Khoo](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~ykhoo). 

<!-- I will move to Stanford University as a PhD student in Computational and Mathematical Engineering starting this fall, advised by Prof. Lexing Ying. -->

# Recent news
- The paper [Quantum Simulations of Fermionic Hamiltonians with Efficient Encoding and Ansatz Schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01912) has been accepted by Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation! In this work we propose a computational protocol for quantum simulations of Fermionic Hamiltonians on a quantum computer.
- The paper [Low Rank Green's Function Representations Applied to Dynamical Mean-Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07764) has been posted to the Arxiv! In this work we show that via a low rank decomposition, only 20-30 Matsubara frequency nodes are necessary for the Dyson equation solver of the dynamical mean-field theory, compared to 2000 which is typically used. Thanks to all of my collaborators at the Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation!
- The paper [Quantum Simulations of Fermionic Hamiltonians with Efficient Encoding and Ansatz Schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01912) has been posted to the Arxiv! Focusing on quantum simulations of Fermionic Hamiltonians on a quantum computer, we show a substantial improvement in the scaling of circuit gate counts and a decrease in the number of required variational parameters.
- The paper [Quantum Embedding Theories to Simulate Condensed Systems on Quantum Computers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00279-0) has been published by Nature Computational Science (7/25/2022)! It is aimed at discussing different embedding theories and the perspective for their simulations on quantum computers.
- I gave an exciting talk in the APS March meeting 2022 on solving the double counting issue in quantum defect embedding theory (3/15/2022)! See the slides [here](/files/talks/Nan_Sheng_2022.pdf). I also contribute to Dr. Christian Vorwerk's talk on the application of the embedding theory to oxides. See the slides [here](/files/talks/Christian_Vorwerk_2022.pdf).
- The paper [Green's Function Formulation of Quantum Defect Embedding Theory](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00240) has been published by Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation (6/1/2022)! It is aimed at solving the double counting issue in quantum defect embedding theory.
- I gave an exciting talk as the end of my experience (8/13/2021)! See the slides [here](/files/talks/DLR%40CCQ.pdf). I will work remotely with colleagues to finish the project.
- I just start an internship at the Flatiron Institute, working with Dr. Olivier Parcollet, Dr. Jason Kaye and Dr. Kun Chen (6/3/2021).
