<!-- <h2> Research interest </h2>  -->
Generally, I am interested in developing hybrid quantum-classical theories and methods, which includes the following three parts.

* <b>Quantum Many-Body Physics</b>
  * <b>Areas:</b> <br>
    Quantum embedding theory (QET) <br>
    Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) <br>
    Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) <br>
    Density functional theory (DFT) <br>
    Matrix product states (MPS) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) <br>
    Post-Hartree-Fock (post-HF)
  * <b>Focus:</b> <br>
    Quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) for strongly-correlated electronic states in defective systems <br>
    Discrete Lehnmann representation (DLR) for DMFT and MBPT <br>
    First-principles studies and predictions of spin qubits using QDET
    
* <b>Quantum Computation and Simulation </b>
  * <b>Areas:</b> <br>
    Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) <br>
    Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) <br>
  * <b>Focus:</b> <br>
    Error mitigation scheme for quantum algorithms <br>
    Quantum algorithms as solvers for downfolded Hamiltonians
    
* <b>Scientific Computing</b>
  * <b>Areas:</b> <br>
    Numerical computing <br>
    Parallel computing
  * <b>Focus:</b> <br>
    Development of open source software [WEST](http://www.west-code.org) (Without Empty States) for MBPT calculations <br>
    Development of open source software [TRIQS](https://triqs.github.io/triqs/latest) (Toolbox for Research on Interacting Quantum Systems) for DMFT calculations
